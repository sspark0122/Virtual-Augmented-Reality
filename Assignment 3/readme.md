### Part 1
Insert your answers to the questions below

### Google Earth VR Questions

1. Where did you go and why?
- I graduated from Binghamton University in 2015. Since I wondered what the university looks like now, I went to the university.

2. Did you feel ‘present’ in those locations? Why or why not?
- I didn't feel 'present' in the place because Google Earth VR's clarity is too blurry.

3. Did you feel motion sickness while exploring the world? If so, what do you think caused that feeling?
- I felt motion sickness because I felt untethered from the space I'm in.

4. Do you consider the UI/UX in Google Earth VR to be intuitive? Why or why not?
- I think UI in Google Earth VR is intuitive because it took less time for me to learn how to use the application. However, UX in Google Earth VR is not intuitive.
I was uncomfortable becasue I was flying around the place, not walking.


### Rec Room Questions

1. Did you feel connected to your avatar after customizing them? Why or why not?
- No, even though I could customize my avatar, the avatar didn't look like me.

2. When socializing with others, did it feel as if you were connecting with them on the same level as if you were in the same physical space? Why or why not?
- Yes, because I could see them moving and greeting in real time at the same place.

3. Do you consider the UI/UX in Rec Room to be intuitive? Why or why not?
- I think UI is not intuitive because it is hard for me to find buttons I want. However, UX is intuitive because it was fun to interact with others.

### Work Summary:

[I assigned a custom skybox material to the scene and modified the fog color. I placed an object slightly above the table and added physics to my Poly asset. Also, I added the capability to pick up and throw my Poly asset. Then I set up ModelBrowser and enabled physics for PhysicsItem. I made the half pipe slippery and the PhysicsItem throwable. Then I added the ability to scale the currently held physics, animation reset, and Logo functionality. Getting the original spawn position was a little bit tricky for me, but I solved it using FindGameObjectWithTag. I have not completed bonus task.]
