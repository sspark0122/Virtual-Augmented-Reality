### Work Summary:

[I added lighting and textures in the scene. Then, I created Character Navigation including Destination Point, Wave and Walking. Lastly, I added Teleportation, Solar System, Blcok Creation and Weather stations. I have not completed bonus task.]

### Super Mode Implementation:

[I added two buttons called "Super Mode Start" and "Super Mode End" at the Black Creation Station. "Super Mode Start" sets gravity to zero for my entire scene and "Super Mode End" sets gravity to normal(9.8 m/s^2) for my entire scene. I added the implementation in the BlockCreationManager.cs]
