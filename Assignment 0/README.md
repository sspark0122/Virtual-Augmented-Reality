Assignment Task
The task for this assignment is to animate the TextMesh, which breaks down to the following mini tasks:
Initialise the TextMesh with your NetID in the C# script (0 point if you implement it in the Inspector window);
Set up the reference between the SimpleAnimator and the SceneController in the C# script (0 point if you implement it in the Inspector window);
Let the “Set New Position” button listen to click inputs. Upon clicking on the button, the SceneController randomly generates a target position where the TextMesh will move towards (0 point if you implement it in the Inspector window);
Rotate the TextMesh 360 degrees around its local Z axis once it arrives the target position;
Use c_MoveTowardsSpeed as the movement speed of TextMesh and c_RotationSpeed as the rotation speed;
[Bonus Task] The “Set New Position” button is not interactable in the middle of an active animation.
[Bonus Task] Use StartCoroutine to animate the rotation.
