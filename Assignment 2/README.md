### Work Summary:

[In Start(), I added listerners for a button and ContentPositioningBehaviour. In SpawnNewMarker(), 
I created a counter to see how many clicks I had, and stored a first marker and a second marker in GameObjects called start_marker and end_marker. Then, I set m_nowState to AnimatingLineDraw to draw a line between the two markers. In Update(), I drew a line and display the distance in meters between the two markers. Then, I set m_nowState to ReadyToSpawnAstronaut to spawn an astronaut. When m_nowState is ReadyToSpawnAstronaut, I spawned an astronaut, then spawned a cube above the astronautâ€™s head when the astronaut is selected. In addtion, Whenever an user clicks "Clear" button, the sscene is reset. At last, I did a bonus task: Adding sound-effects when placing the astronaut on the ground, and when the cubes hit the astronaut.]
